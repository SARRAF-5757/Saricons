# Saricons
Saricons is a fork of Lawnicons that is always up-to-date with the latest version of Lawnicons and includes additional icons to make your app drawer feel more complete. Another perk, if you don't know how to contribute to the main project, you can request icons to be added here.
These icons can be used normally as an add-on for adding themed icons to [Lawnchair 12](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair).

### Things to Note
* Although this fork was made to contribute to the original Lawnicons fork, these icons will most likely never be merged to the original project since although they do look similar to the rest of the icons, do not follow the exact guidelines of lawnicons. So, this fork will continue on its own while staying up-to-date with the latest builds of Lawnicons.
* Some of the icons in this fork were recreated from other android icon packs such as [Linex Black](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jndapp.linex.black.iconpack&hl=en_US&gl=US) by [JustNewDesigns](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6871333323804023406), [Reed Dark](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reevdark.grabsterstudios&hl=en_US&gl=US) by [Grabster Studios](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5292302577722645992).
